# Esperance Protocol 🚀

## Introduction 🛠️

**Esperance Protocol** is an open-source, fully decentralized blockchain written entirely in C.

## Why This Project? 🎯

I embarked on this journey because I find it incredibly fun to build my own blockchain from scratch. Creating a complete system for transactions and smart contracts is a challenging yet exciting endeavor!

## Features 🔹

- Written entirely in **C** for performance and control.
- Fully **decentralized** and **open-source**.
- **Custom transaction system** and **real-time transaction ledger updates**.
- **Encryption system (`ft_cryptage`)** for private keys and transactions.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism**, similar to Solana.
- Designed to be **lightweight and highly optimized** for all types of devices.
- Compatible with **Windows (via WSL) and Linux**.
- Each node **synchronizes with its closest neighbors**, updating wallet states and recent transactions.

*(Note: These are just some initial features as the project is still in its early stages.)*

## Development Timeline ⏳

This is a highly ambitious project, and since I’m currently studying at **42 Lyon**, my available time is limited. If everything progresses well, the project could be finalized in about **two years**.

## Conclusion 🎉

Esperance Protocol is a passion-driven project. It may take time, but the thrill of building a blockchain from the ground up makes it absolutely worth it! If you're curious or want to contribute, feel free to check it out. 😉

🚀 **Stay tuned for updates!**
